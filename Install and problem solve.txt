# codeigniter4-master
 codeigniter 4.5.1 php 8

Install:
composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter myapp

setup database app/Config/Database.php




Problem 1:
    - codeigniter4/framework[4.0.0, ..., v4.5.1] require ext-intl * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's intl extension.
    - Root composer.json requires codeigniter4/framework ^4.0 -> satisfiable by codeigniter4/framework[4.0.0, ..., v4.5.1].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - C:\xampp\php\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-intl` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

solve:
;extension=intl --> extension=intl pada php.ini
